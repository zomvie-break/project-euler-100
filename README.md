# Intro

In this repo, I'll be adding my solutions (and comments) on the first 100 problems from [project euler](https://projecteuler.net). 

## Why only the first 100 problems?

To make solving the problems of the project euler enjoyable, users only get permission to discuss the first 100. What fun would it be to find the answer online?
